# Mokro hub schematics

Here, you can find the electronic circuits schematics for individual hardware units and their components. 

The schematics were drafted using the [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/) software.

Feel free to check out the schematics, and understand how Mokro units work under the hood.

Below is a simple overview of each module.

## Watchdog

> A unit that is responsible for reading and reporting the soil moisture level.
